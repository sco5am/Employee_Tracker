## Description
For this assignment I was tasked with creating a command-line application to manage a company's employee database. After initializing the app, the user will be presented with a list of options including viewing all employees, roles, and department. When one of theses options is selected, the database will populate with the example information located in the seeds.sql file. The user can also add an employee, department, or role, as well as a option to update an employees role.  

This assignment helped me to better familiarize myself with Node,js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Usage
Once the user clones the project from GitHub, they will run npm install to require all required dependencies. Users will then run the schema.sql and seeds.sql files in their MySQL workbench. After that step is completed, type node . into the command line to initialize the app.

A video walkthrough of the app's functionality can be viewed below.
